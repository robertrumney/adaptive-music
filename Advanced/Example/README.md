# AdvancedGameMusic - Example Usage

This repository provides a simple example on how to utilize the `AdvancedGameMusic` system in Unity to manage and transition between different game music states based on in-game events.

## Overview

The `AdvancedGameMusic` system allows for smooth transitions between different music states in a game. In this example, we demonstrate how to change the music based on simulated game events triggered by key presses.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have the `AdvancedGameMusic` script in your project.
2. Attach the `AdvancedGameMusic` script to a GameObject in your scene.
3. Add two AudioSource components to the same GameObject for music transitions.
4. Configure the music states and associate audio clips via the Unity inspector.

## How to Use

In the provided `GameEventManager` script:

- **Start**: The game initializes with "Chill" music.
- **D Key**: Simulates entering a dangerous zone, transitioning the music to "Danger".
- **B Key**: Simulates the start of a battle, switching the music to "Battle".
- **V Key**: Simulates victory in the battle, transitioning the music to "Victory".
- **X Key**: Simulates the player's death, changing the music to "Death".
- **C Key**: Returns the game to a relaxed state, reverting the music back to "Chill".

You can expand upon this example by adding more game events or by integrating real gameplay events to change the music state.

## Customization

The `AdvancedGameMusic` system is designed to be easily expandable. You can add more music states by updating the `MusicState` enumeration and adding corresponding entries in the `musicEntries` array in the Unity inspector.
