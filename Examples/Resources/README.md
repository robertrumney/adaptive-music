# Unity Music Management with Resources

This tutorial explains how to dynamically load new music tracks, death music, and optional transitions in Unity using the `MusicManagement` script and the `Resources` folder in response to a specific action.

## Overview

The `MusicManagement` script allows you to change the music and audio in your game during runtime. By placing your audio clips in the `Resources` folder, you can easily load them into the game using the script when a specific action occurs.

## Setup

1. Create a new script called `MusicManagement.cs` and attach it to a game object in your scene.
2. Ensure you have a `Resources` folder in your Unity project (create one if needed).
3. Place your new music tracks, death music, and optional transitions in the `Resources` folder.

## Usage

1. Open the `MusicManagement` script and define public string variables for each audio clip you want to load (e.g., `newMusic1Path`, `newMusic2Path`).
2. Determine the specific action in your game that triggers the audio change (e.g., player reaching a certain level, picking up an item).
3. In response to that action, use `Resources.Load<AudioClip>(path)` to load the audio clips from the `Resources` folder based on the specified file paths.
4. Assign the loaded audio clips to the corresponding variables in the `GameMusic` script using `GameMusic.instance`.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class MusicManagement : MonoBehaviour
{
    public string newMusic1Path;
    public string newMusic2Path;

    public void LoadNewMusic()
    {
        // Load new music tracks from Resources folder
        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(newMusic1Path))
        {
            AudioClip newMusic1 = Resources.Load<AudioClip>(newMusic1Path);
            if (newMusic1 != null)
                GameMusic.instance.music1.clip = newMusic1;
        }

        // Load other audio clips...
    }
}
```
